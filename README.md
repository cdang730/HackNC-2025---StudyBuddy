# 📚HackNC-2025---StudyBuddy  
HackNC 2025 — Beginner & Community Track


## 🌟 Overview  
Study Buddy Finder is a simple web app built with Python and Streamlit that helps students find others who want to study the same subject at the same time and mode (virtual or in-person).


## 🧠 Inspiration  
As leveling up in college. Students may want to connect and study together for the same subject or courses. Finding motivated partners for users and link two students is our goal. 


## ⚙️ How It Works  
- Users meet each other based on their input time and subject.
- First, they log in/sign up using either Google or username and password. 
- Users can choose from different subject like Math, English, History, CS, and Science. 
- Users can choose the mode of meeting: virtual or in-person. There is also a privacy choice for users, they can indicate their preference if they would like to be find by other users. 
- Users can also leave their contact information for other users to contact + encryption?
- Users can also choose to delete their information in the users.csv file when they no longer need a study buddy for certain subject. 

## 🤖 AI Usage  
- Generate idea/prompt that lead to the finalized idea of Study Buddy.
- Create Streamlit and put those Stremlit command to run. 
- Did small encryption from hashlib, used hashlib.sha256 to encrypt users' master password. 
- Helped with debugging the Google login and delete features
